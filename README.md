# rmap-shell-installer
Set of shell scripts to support installation of RMap components on Centos7. 

These scripts are a **work in progress**. 

The goal is to convert the steps in the (RMap Installation documentation)[https://rmap-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/RMAPPS/Installation ] into individual bash scripts. The user will first be required to populate a properties file that supports the configuration of supporting services, then run scripts to install the various components.  The scripts can be run on a single server or separate servers.
